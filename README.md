GifTastic utilizes basic API's to pull in different gifs

1. This is a movie Gif Search.

2. You will start with 9 different Gif image buttons to choose from.

3. You can click on each button to pull up 10 different images and their respective rating.

4. Each image is still, when you click on the image it will animate.

5. You can also click on the same image to stop the animation.

6. In the input box labeled “Input Movie” you can search whichever movie you would like and then hit the “Submit” button.

7. Once you hit submit you will now have a new button at the top of your list to choose 10 images from.
